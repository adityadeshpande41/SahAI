Build a modern, polished, responsive frontend web app called SahAI.

Product concept

SahAI is a voice-first, accessibility-first health copilot with a “Routine Twin” interface. It helps users track meds, meals, symptoms, and activity, and shows context-aware guidance (time, weather, location/activity) in a friendly, simple way.

This Replit version should focus on:

beautiful frontend design

mobile + desktop responsive experience

demo-ready UI flows with mock data

light mode + dark mode

accessibility-first UI patterns

Do not build full backend logic yet. Use mock data, local state, and placeholder service calls so backend APIs can be connected later.

Tech / UI requirements

Build as a responsive web app (mobile-first but great on desktop)

Use a clean modern stack (React + Tailwind preferred)

Include light mode and dark mode

Use smooth animations and transitions (subtle, not flashy)

Use reusable components

Keep the UI calm, health-focused, elder-friendly, and premium

Make it easy to connect a backend later (clear separation of UI components vs mock service layer)

Global design style

Design should feel:

warm and trustworthy

clean, minimal, modern

easy for older adults

visually polished for hackathon demo judges

UI style details

rounded cards

soft shadows

large tap targets

clear hierarchy

strong contrast in both themes

readable fonts

icon support (meds, food, alerts, weather, voice, caregiver)

High contrast mode

Simple language mode

Big-button mode

Read-aloud toggle

Slower speech toggle

Language selector

Teach-back mode toggle

Requirement

Changes should visibly update the UI in real time (especially:

text size

contrast

button sizing

simplified copy where possible)

Mobile + desktop responsiveness requirements

Mobile-first layouts

Bottom navigation on mobile

Sidebar navigation on desktop/tablet

Sticky quick actions on mobile where helpful

Cards should stack well on small screens

Ensure touch targets are large enough for elderly users

Test layouts for:

small phone

large phone

tablet

desktop

Navigation structure

Use a clean navigation system with icons.

Suggested tabs/pages

Home

Meds

Meals

Symptoms

Talk

Insights

Caregiver

Settings

On mobile:

use bottom nav for primary pages

secondary pages can open as stacked screens or modals

Demo data and mock state (important)

Build with realistic mock data so the app looks alive.

Include mock examples for:

user profile

medication schedule

meal logs

symptom logs

activity logs

context snapshots (weather/time/location state)

risk alerts

summaries

Include at least 3 demo scenarios

Normal day (green state)

Drift detected (yellow state)

delayed lunch + med due

Higher concern (red state)

user outside + hot weather + symptom logged

Make it easy to switch scenarios from a hidden dev/demo toggle.

Component requirements (important for future backend integration)

Keep UI components clean and reusable.

Create separate components for:

AvatarCard / TwinStateCard

StatusChips

QuickActionsGrid

RiskGuidanceCard

ExplainabilityPanel

MedicationCard

MealCard

SymptomLogger

ActivityLogger

ChatWindow

AccessibilityControls

SummaryCard

Also create a simple mock service layer file/module with functions like:

getDashboardData()

getMedications()

logMeal()

logSymptom()

getRiskGuidance()

getSummaries()

This should return mock JSON now, and can later be replaced by backend API calls from Kiro.

Theme requirements (light + dark mode)

Implement full theme support:

light mode

dark mode

system mode (optional)

Ensure:

all cards, chips, buttons, alerts, and text are readable in both modes

health risk colors are accessible (not neon)

contrast remains good in high contrast mode

Animation / polish

Add tasteful micro-interactions:

button press feedback

card hover on desktop

smooth page transitions

accordion expand/collapse

chip state animations

subtle avatar state animation (optional)

Keep it smooth and professional, not overly flashy.

Accessibility requirements (frontend)

semantic HTML where possible

keyboard navigable

clear focus states

ARIA labels for important controls

large readable text option

contrast-safe color choices

avoid tiny icons/buttons

do not rely only on color for risk states (also use labels/icons)

Non-functional requirements

Clean folder structure

Reusable components

Mock data isolated from UI

Easy to connect backend later

Environment-ready placeholders for:

OpenAI

ElevenLabs

weather API

location API

nutrition API
